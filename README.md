[Travel Site](https://tls11.github.io/travel-site)

Site built following Brad Schiff's excellent [Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/overview) course.

Building this site taught me a lot about:

* Mobile First Development
* Responsive Design
* BEM (Block Element Modifier) Methodology
* OOP
* Gulp
* PostCSS
* Babel
* Webpack
* Lazy Loading
* Minification
* Uglification
